# Challenge one : 
## Drone Command Challenge

Objective: 
Write a program using the provided code to control a drone through command-line input.

Instructions:

1.	Familiarize yourself with the given code, which sets up a command-line interface to send commands to a drone using UDP communication.

2.	Your challenge is to extend the existing code to include additional commands for drone control.

3.	Implement the following commands:

	takeoff: Sends a command to the drone to initiate takeoff.

	land: Sends a command to the drone to initiate landing.

	up <distance>: Sends a command to the drone to ascend to the specified distance (in cm).

	down <distance>: Sends a command to the drone to descend by the specified distance (in cm).

	forward <distance>: Sends a command to the drone to move forward by the specified distance (in meters).

	backward <distance>: Sends a command to the drone to move backward by the specified distance (in meters).

	left <distance>: Sends a command to the drone to move to the left by the specified distance (in meters).

	right <distance>: Sends a command to the drone to move to the right by the specified distance (in meters).

	rotate <angle>: Sends a command to the drone to rotate by the specified angle (in degrees).



4.	Test your program by running it and entering different commands to control the drone.

5.	Use the console output and the drone's response to verify the successful execution of each command.

6.	Once you have completed the challenge, share your code and demonstrate the drone control functionality.


Note: Make sure you have a compatible drone and establish the correct connection settings (such as IP address and port) in the code before testing. Ensure that you follow all safety guidelines and regulations while operating the drone.

Good luck with the challenge! Have fun experimenting with drone control through code.
